# Data Banks

Data Banks are collections of datasets made available on TGDeX. These may include information like health records, satellite imagery, public service logs, or other structured/unstructured data that can be used for analysis, research, or building AI solutions.

## Data Banks Listing Page

The Data Banks Listing page offers a consolidated view of all available Data Banks, complete with a search bar, sorting options and a collapsible filter panel (by organization type, department, access status and more) to help users pinpoint relevant assets. Each Data Bank is presented as a card showing its title, publisher, readiness score, file type, access level and a brief description, with a “View Data Bank” button to access full details or download options.

### Data Banks Search Bar
Positioned at the top of the Data Bank Listing page, the search bar lets users enter keywords to quickly locate specific Data Banks. As users type, it offers instant suggestions and filters the displayed cards to match titles, descriptions or tags, streamlining the discovery process.

### Filter Feature
The filter panel is divided into several sections, each allowing users to narrow the Data Bank listing according to specific criteria:
- Organization Type:
    - All: Includes Data Banks from every source.
    - Public: Data Banks published by government departments or publicly funded entities.
    - Private: Data Banks contributed by private companies or startups.
    - Academic Institution: Data Banks originating from universities and research institutes.
    - Other: Data Banks from NGOs, community groups or any other type of organization.

- Access Status:
  - Open: Publicly available Data Banks with immediate download access.
  - Restricted: Data Banks requiring approval or elevated permissions to download.
- File Type: Choose from formats like CSV, PDF, TXT, Shapefile, image files etc. Selecting multiple types returns any Data Bank offering at least one of the chosen formats.
- Data Readiness: Use predefined ranges (e.g., 0–20%, 20–40%, 40–60%, 60–80% and greater than 80%) to filter by data readiness and usability of data bank to build AI models. Higher readiness score indicates more fully documented and clean Data Banks.
- Last Updated: Restrict results to data banks updated in last 7 days, last 30 days, last 1 year or within a custom date range.

  ![Data Bank Preview](./img/fig_data_bank_preview.png)

### Data Visualization
The Visualization panel lets users create basic charts directly from the Data Bank—no coding required. By selecting one or more columns as the X-axis (dimensions) and additional columns as series (metrics), users can generate column, line or pie charts. Download button also enables users to export the chart. Key components:

- **Chart Type Selector:** Choose between Column, Line or Pie charts.

## Using Data Bank in Sandbox IDE

Once the Sandbox IDE has been instantiated, you will see a templated starter notebook with the following information:

- Type of notebook instance - CPU only or GPU instance
- The available resources for that notebook - Available CPU cycles and Available RAM, Available VRAM (in case of GPU notebook)
- Started TGDeX SDK instantiated (with imports)

The started TGDeX SDK requires you to input your credentials and the databank of interest and fetches the Databank of interest into your workspace.

You can fetch Data Bank ID from the detail page of that particular data bank by clicking on copy icon.
![Copying Data Bank ID](./img/fig_copying_data_bank_id.png)
Figure below shows the section of the starter sdk which allows you to download a databank.
![Downloading Data Bank in IDE](./img/fig_downloading_data_bank_in_ide.png)
Once the fetching process is complete, you will find the databank of interest in the “In-Notebook” file interface as shown in the figure below.
