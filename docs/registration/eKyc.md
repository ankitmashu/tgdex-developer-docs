To upgrade their role, access computing resources, or begin publishing Data Banks, AI Models, or Potential Applications, users must complete **eKYC** through DigiLocker. During this digital verification, users grant TGDeX permission to retrieve identity details (name, address, and photo) directly from their DigiLocker account, which is linked to their Aadhaar.

Users can complete their eKYC verification by following the steps outlined below:

**Step 1:** Go to your **My Profile** section and click on **Complete Your eKYC**.
